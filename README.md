# AI Trust Stack

A next-generation AI platform designed to help organizations assess the perceived trustworthiness of their own content and product communications — or others — through the lens of the consumer experience.

## Overview

Designed for B2B use, the platform helps companies audit and benchmark front-facing communications, content, and interactions based on how they are received by real people. Using a multiagent AI architecture, the system analyzes brand assets and experiences through a five-dimensional trust framework to generate actionable trust scores, insights, and tailored reports with recommendations to enhance experience credibility and connection.

## The Five-Dimensional Trust Framework

### 🔍 **PROVENANCE**
Clear authorship and traceable accountability — human, AI, or hybrid. Verifiable authorship.

### 🎯 **RESONANCE**
Personalization that's intentional, situational, and respectful — not creepy.

### 🔗 **COHERENCE**
Emotional and logical alignment across every interaction, not just one touch point.

### 🔓 **TRANSPARENCY**
Explainable systems. Users understand what's happening and why.

### ✅ **VERIFICATION**
Trust based on proof — not popularity, polish, or hype.
